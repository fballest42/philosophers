It is the classical problem often used in concurrent algorithm design to illustrate synchronization issues and techniques for resolving them. More info about this problem on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem).

#### &emsp; · Total time in miliseconds before die = 410.
#### &emsp; · Total time eating in miliseconds = 200.
#### &emsp; · Total time thinking in miliseconds = 200.
#### &emsp; · Number of times that each philo must eat = 10 (optional, take out for infinite number of times).
